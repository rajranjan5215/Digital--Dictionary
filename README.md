# Digital--Dictionary
Digital Dictionnary  takes voice as input and return the meaning of the word in voice as weel as  on screen too. It uses Google text to speech to covert the text format to voice format and provided code coverts speech to text. Here i have used the python coding language and JSON File to store the database.
